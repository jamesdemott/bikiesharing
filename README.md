# Bike Sharing! 

## Overview of the Analysis
My purpose in this exercise was to leverage Tableau Public's services to visualize some user trends. Of interest were geographical and gender use patterns which will inform CitiBike's subsequent user research.

## Summary
My initial analysis of CitiBike's data is that their largest demographic is commuting men. Future user research should be aimed at interviewing women about what could encourage more ridership with this demographic. Other visualizations that would be interesting would be a map coded by start time and another map coded by trip duration. 

## Results 

### Trips by Gender and Age
I built a calculated field to get a users age (current year minus birth year) and then created an area chart by gender. This shows that the typical user is in their mid-30s, regardless of gender and also evidences the gender disparity in CitiBike's ridership.

### Trip Start Times
We can see that the most popular time for checkouts is around 5 AM.

### Trips by Gender
We see that there's a strong gender disparity in that men are riding much more frequently. However both men and women are similarly likely to begin a trip during peak hours.

### Trips by Weekday Per Hour 
Unsurprisingly, this graph indicates that what we would expect are traditional "rush hour" times see the largest volume.

### Trips by Gender (Weekday Per Hour)
This chart further evidences the gender disparity between men and women usership and suggests that Thursday is a popular bike to work day as comute hours for this section are higher.

### Trips by Gender by Weekday and User Type
This chart shows us that men are more likely to be subsrcibers than women and that users who have not got a full profile are more likely to be weekend riders.

### Trip Starting Location 
This map evidences where the most-used station for trip starts are. Unsurprisingly, most trips begin in lower Manhattan and or Midtown East.
